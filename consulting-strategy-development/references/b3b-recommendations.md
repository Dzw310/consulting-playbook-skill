# B3 Module B: Developing High-Impact Recommendations

## Sub-Module 1: Interim Recommendation Pack (Direction Now, Precision Later)

Build an interim recommendation pack even before all data is in:

- "Here is the best path forward now"
- "Here are the few uncertainties that matter and how we will resolve them"

Lack of data is not an excuse — it is a prompt to separate "direction" from "remaining decision-critical analyses."

---

## Sub-Module 2: GTM Issue Tree (MECE) — Start with Customer, Not Product

Build a MECE issue tree before talking tactics:

1. **Which segments to target**
2. **What product(s) to offer**
3. **How to market and go-to-market** (value chain role, distribution/brand, customer acquisition/retention)

Drill one level deeper per branch only as far as needed to drive decisions. Don't start with Product — start with Customer.

---

## Sub-Module 3: STP → Then 4Ps (Fix the Classic Misuse)

Apply marketing frameworks in the right order:

1. **STP:** Segmentation → Targeting → Positioning
2. Then **4Ps:** Product, Price, Place, Promotion

Product choices are meaningless until you commit to who you serve and how you position. "STP first, then 4Ps" is a clear signal of structured GTM thinking.

---

## Sub-Module 4: Segment Choice — 4 Evaluation Lenses

For "who to target," evaluate segments on:

1. **Need/Appeal** for the benefit
2. **Size + growth** of the segment
3. **Practical targetability** (can you reach them efficiently?)
4. **Early vs late adopters** (especially in a new market)

Prioritize segments that are high-appeal, reachable, and likely early adopters. "They want it" is not enough — add "and we can reach them."

---

## Sub-Module 5: Product Strategy = Feasible × Appealing to Target Segments

Define product set by intersecting:
- **Feasibility:** what can you realistically develop in the next ~5 years?
- **Appeal:** what will target segments adopt?

Map adoption sequence: who enters when, with which product maturity. This is a **dynamic strategy** — tell a sequence, not a static target list.

---

## Sub-Module 6: Early vs Late Entry — Option Framing

When facing a true trade-off, build a two-sided case:

**Go early:** foothold, learning curve, market seeding, brand building, negotiation leverage

**Go late:** avoid "bad product" stigma, protect critical relationships and core business

Then choose consultant mode:
- (A) Make a recommendation **with mitigations** for the key risks, or
- (B) Present **structured options** + criteria + case studies and facilitate the client's decision

Sometimes the best consulting output is not a single answer, but a structured decision process.

---

## Sub-Module 7: Risk Mitigation as a Required Part of the Recommendation

If you choose a path, immediately pair it with risk mitigations:

1. Identify top risks (brand damage, regulatory backlash, capacity constraints)
2. Design mitigations (pilot tests, controlled launches, proactive regulator conversations)
3. Decide if residual risk is acceptable; if not, reconsider the strategy

Naming risks is table stakes — controlling them is the value.

---

## Sub-Module 8: Value Chain Role Framework (Where to Play + How to Brand)

Lay out discrete strategic "boxes" before committing:
- **Where to play:** ingredient player vs food manufacturer vs branded retail
- **How to play:** branded vs private label

Evaluate each box with criteria: investment required, flexibility to pivot, barriers to entry, margin potential. Enrich judgment with case studies per box.

You can add value without picking a box yet — structure the debate so the client can decide well.

---

## Sub-Module 12: Recommendation Critique Checklist (5 Upgrades)

Strengthen any recommendation by forcing these five upgrades:

1. **Specific action** (not generic advice — name the exact move)
2. **Quantified impact** (top-line or key metric with numbers)
3. **Competitive context** (value prop vs alternatives; retaliation risk)
4. **Risks + mitigations** (anticipate skeptic questions before they are asked)
5. **Implementation specificity** (what changes in systems/processes to make it real)

Strategy advice must be executable and skeptic-proof, not just logically correct.

---

## Sub-Module 13: "Move the Needle" Financial Math (Include Cannibalization)

Front-end the recommendation with financial magnitude:

1. Estimate incremental adopters at new price/offering
2. Compute incremental revenue
3. **Subtract cannibalization** from existing customers switching down
4. Communicate **net impact** in one line

**Always state net impact and show you accounted for cannibalization.** "We generate $3M, but we lose $0.15M from existing customers switching, so the net is ~$3M incremental."

---

## Sub-Module 14: 80/20 Synthesis for Value Proposition vs Competitors

Avoid "table-walk fishing expeditions":

1. Use attribute-importance data to pick the **few attributes that matter**
2. Compare competitors only on those attributes
3. Produce a **2–3 sentence synthesized value proposition**

The best answer is a tight synthesis, not a walkthrough of every data point.

---

## Sub-Module 15: Proactive Risk Analysis (Skeptic-Proof Before You Present)

For every recommendation:

1. Ask: "What would a skeptic attack?"
2. List risks (capacity, brand experience, retaliation, operational complexity)
3. Mitigate via constraints, design tweaks, pilots, best-practice learning
4. If risk is severe and uncontrollable — **withdraw the recommendation**

**If you answer skeptics before they speak, you manufacture trust.** This is the most visible signal of maturity in strategy presentations.

---

## Sub-Module 17: Quant + Qual Fusion (Needle-in-a-Haystack Insight)

To solve "how can we improve X without massive capex":

1. Look at quant ratings (e.g., "accessibility" rated low)
2. Find a qual question that explains "what they really mean" (e.g., heavy users demand multi-site access, not closer locations)
3. Re-define the problem and unlock a low-cost lever

Translate a metric into the underlying need.

---

## Sub-Module 18: Win Where You Are Defensible (Brand-Consistent Strategy)

Choose battles aligned with your brand and structural advantages:
- If a competitor owns "high-end equipment," don't imitate by default
- Compete where you can build a durable edge (access, hours, convenience)
- Verify that your strategy aligns with brand identity

If the recommendation contradicts the brand, call it out explicitly as a heavier transformation requiring re-positioning and organizational change.

---

## Sub-Module 19: Segment Pricing + Tiered Offerings (Always Model Cost Side)

For tiered pricing recommendations:

1. Design tiers with clear benefit differences (access, hours, features)
2. Quantify revenue upside with scenarios (e.g., 20% / 40% customer uplift)
3. **Explicitly model operational costs** (longer hours staffing, system changes)

If cost data is missing, you must still surface it as a required next step. Call out critical gaps — don't pretend they don't exist.

---

## Sub-Module 21: Robust Recommendations Framework (4-Part Checklist)

Use this architecture for every major recommendation:

1. **Optimal strategy selection** — explore alternatives; show why this one wins
2. **Maximum impact design** — specific, evidence-based, quantified impact + cost, risk-aware
3. **Implementation roadmap** — time, resources, milestones, metrics, staged investment, contingencies
4. **Organizational alignment** — skills, culture, brand, partners, channels; scalability

---

## Sub-Module 20: Bonus Insight Handling (Light Touch)

When you find a "freebie" insight outside scope:
- Don't ignore it
- Don't let it derail focus
- Deliver as a small appendix: quick estimate + relevance check vs baseline

**Contextualize the size:** If the baseline is $100M revenue and the bonus insight adds $0.5M, say so. Offer the insight, then put it in perspective so you don't oversell it.

---

## Final Self-Check Before Presenting

- [ ] Did I **quantify** impact and contextualize it vs baseline priorities?
- [ ] Did I use 80/20 to produce a **tight synthesis**, not a data walkthrough?
- [ ] Did I preempt the skeptic with **risks + mitigations** and a "buttoned-up" story?
- [ ] Did I name **implementation requirements** (systems, processes, costs) even if I lack data?
- [ ] Did I confirm **brand/organizational alignment**, or am I accidentally recommending a re-positioning?
- [ ] For true trade-offs, did I consider **option framing + facilitation** as a valid, high-value output?

The common failure is not missing a detail — it's failing to surface the decision-critical gaps.
