# B1: Stakeholder Interviews and Expert Engagement

## Stakeholder Targeting (5 Filters)

Start with the **org chart**, not a function guess. Build or request the org chart first, then select interviewees using these filters:

1. **Information ownership** — who actually has the data or decisions?
2. **Bias check** — who can provide a fresh, contrarian, or more objective view?
3. **Right altitude** — VP vs Director depends on question type and "respect for time"
4. **Buy-in needs** — who must feel respected and "in the loop" to avoid blocking access later?
5. **Credibility + execution power** — who is trusted, measured, and can "get things done" internally?

**Triangulation rule:** For strategic or multi-sided questions, collect 3–5 interviews across functions/levels until diminishing returns (when you can predict what the next person will say).

**Bias is a data-quality problem:** The person with the most information may also have the strongest motive to package it favorably. Actively seek contrarian sources.

## Handling Resistance (Agree → Trust → Close)

When you detect resistance (tone/body language, deflection, discomfort):

1. **Switch objective** — from "extract all answers now" → "earn trust + access path"
2. **Bridge-build** first:
   - Give context (sponsor asked; you're here to help, not judge)
   - Start with open questions (proud moments, what's working)
3. **Accept influence to gain influence** — if the client asks for something (e.g., best practices), acknowledge and incorporate it, even if it's not on your list
4. **Nudge accountability gently:**
   - Ask about metrics timing ("When could you realistically see ROI from this?")
   - Use a story/analogy to surface risk (e.g., CEO may reject a "big experiment")
5. **Close by aligning on next conversation**, not forcing numbers today

Root cause of resistance is often political, not analytical — the interviewee may think you are there to prove they made a mistake. Address psychological safety first, then data.

## Interview Structure: Intro → Core → Close

**INTRO**
1. Set context: why you're here, what you need, how it links to business outcome
2. Confirm time: "We scheduled 45 minutes — do you still have that?"
3. Diagnose mood: receptive vs anxious vs resistant (even with strong rapport, life events can change the tone)

**CORE — 3 devices used continuously:**
1. **Listening** — words + tone + body language; create pauses to let the client go deeper (silence is a tool, not an awkward gap)
2. **Paraphrasing (3 levels):**
   - Explicit recap (what they said)
   - Implicit inference (what they mean but didn't say)
   - Root-cause hypothesis (what is fundamentally bothering them)
3. **Questioning:**
   - Clarifying questions (terms, leaps of logic)
   - Probing questions (precision, commitments, crux)

**CLOSE**
1. Paraphrase takeaways + confirm next steps
2. End with an open, respectful question (especially if you were "close-question heavy")
3. Keep door open — ask permission for follow-up questions

**POST**
Document same day — type notes, key takeaways, implications. Share in a team system so learning isn't lost. Interview is not done until notes are written.

## Ghost Charting (Template-First Method)

When the expert is cooperative but fuzzy, upgrade from conversation to ghost charting:

1. **Clarify terms** (e.g., "macro" vs "micro" ingredients; define before note-taking)
2. **Pin down ranges to a point estimate** (ask probing questions: "5 or 8 years? Which is more realistic given your budget?")
3. **Paraphrase to validate and tighten** — summarize key points in clean bullet form; let the expert confirm/correct (trust increases when you "organize their brain")
4. **Bring a structured blank template** — timeline or comparison table with rows/columns already set
5. **Co-create attributes + levels** with the expert
6. **Hand off** — expert fills blanks offline and returns; this dramatically improves precision

**Why it works:** Pre-building the deliverable structure forces clarity on hidden choices before execution. Experts often offer to complete the template themselves.

## "I Don't Know" Estimation Playbook

When the expert says "I don't know" — switch tactics, do not stop:

1. **Clarify required precision:** "Order of magnitude is fine — $100M vs $1B vs $10B?"
2. **Offer ranges or binary choices:** "Below $500M or above $500M?" / "Between A–B or B–C?"
3. **Anchor to a known quantity:** compare the unknown market to a market they do know and estimate the share
4. **Bottom-up build:**
   - Start from what they know (their own spend)
   - Ask market structure (how many similar players?)
   - Ask concentration (big players vs long tail?)
   - Do back-of-envelope math; confirm if "directionally right"

**80/20 scope discipline:** When precision is unavailable but a decision must be made, use "Is this 10% or 50% of revenue?" to force scope decisions that unblock the project.

**Efficiency rule:** Ask the laziest high-yield question first ("What's the market size?"), then recover with estimation tactics if they say "I don't know."

## Question Sequencing Cheat Sheet

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| No rapport yet | Open questions, external/historical focus first |
| Resistance detected | Switch to bridge-building before any data extraction |
| Strong trust established | Can use direct closed questions faster |
| Talkative expert, fuzzy answers | Clarify → pin down → paraphrase → ghost chart |
| "I don't know" | Precision reset → ranges → anchor → bottom-up |
| End of meeting | Paraphrase + open respectful close + follow-up permission |
