# B2 Module B: Issue Tree, Workplan, and Hypothesis Tree

## Issue Tree Pruning — Move-the-Needle Test

Build a full MECE issue tree, then **prune ruthlessly** before going deep.

For each branch:
1. Estimate **maximum upside** if this lever is improved (order-of-magnitude is sufficient)
2. Compare upside to the **target goal** (e.g., $50M revenue lift)
3. If upside is small relative to goal → **deprioritize / prune**

Use benchmarks (competitor + historical + internal cross-region) to quickly detect "gaps worth closing." Only after confirming needle-moving potential, go deeper (surveys, call listening, root-cause work).

**Trap:** Don't start with surveys/interviews if you haven't proven the lever is big enough. A large % gap matters only if it converts to meaningful dollars.

## Benchmarking Toolkit (3 Types)

1. **Competitive benchmark** — identify external performance gaps vs peers
2. **Historical benchmark** — spot drift or regression vs your own past
3. **Internal cross-unit benchmark** — compare regions/stores/branches to find best practices and underperformance pockets

Then convert gaps to **potential upside**: "If we bring bottom quartile to average, what's the $ impact?"

Internal benchmarking often produces actionable hypotheses faster than external research.

## Back-of-the-Envelope Impact Test

Before heavy analytics, run quick math to rank branches:

> **Outcome lift ≈ (volume base) × (rate change) × (unit value)**

Example for churn: compute incremental revenue per 1 percentage-point reduction, then compare to goal. Precision is secondary early — **directionally correct ranking** is the goal.

## Fast-Fail Feasibility Gates

Before investing in any initiative:

1. Define **non-negotiable constraints** (regulatory, IT timeline, budget, capability ceiling)
2. Eliminate ideas that fail constraints immediately
3. This prevents late-stage "we can't implement it" surprises

Fast-failing is risk management and focus, not pessimism.

## 2×2 Prioritization (Opportunity vs Ease)

1. List candidate initiatives
2. Y-axis: **Size of opportunity** (revenue / profit / cost / satisfaction)
3. X-axis: **Ease of capture** (time, IT, org change, regulatory burden)
4. Place each idea on the grid (quant where possible, judgment where needed)
5. Converge on **top-right quadrant** first in a stakeholder session

Strategy can be staged — some ideas now, others later. You don't have to pick only one.

---

## Hypothesis Tree (Speed Mode)

Use when you have an educated guess and need speed.

Replace open questions with a **hypothesis statement**. Branches answer: **"What must be true for this hypothesis to hold?"**

Validate only the key conditions; if conditions fail, discard quickly.

**Example — BioCo Market Share Hypothesis ("10%+ share is achievable"):**
1. Market is not fragmented (entry barriers exist)
2. BioCo can clear those barriers (capability to establish claims)
3. Consumers value government-backed health claims
4. IP is protectable (not easily copied)

**Precision trap:** Don't agonize over 8% vs 12% if it won't change the NPV decision.

## Workplan from Each Leaf (5 Elements)

For every leaf question in the issue tree, specify:

| Element | What to define |
|---------|---------------|
| **Analysis** | Exactly what you will compute or test |
| **End product** | The slide, table, or chart you will deliver |
| **Data sources** | Internal / external; who owns it |
| **Timing** | Deadline and milestones |
| **Owner** | Single accountable person |

Sensitivity analysis is often skipped — yet it prevents "sweating the small stuff" (spending time on price components that have negligible revenue impact).

## Ghost Charting (Prevent Delegation Failure)

Before executing any analysis, draw the **intended final slide/chart** even without data.

Forces clarity on hidden choices:
- Which competitors matter? Which geographies?
- Which segments (e.g., corporate vs retail)?
- Which metrics / fee components?
- Which time points?

**Use ghost charting both ways:**
- Manager → junior: specify expectations before handing off
- Junior → manager: confirm alignment proactively before investing effort

**Common delegation failures prevented:**
- Wrong scope (wrong markets or competitor set)
- Wrong metric definition (averaging dissimilar groups)
- Missing key components (the most important metric is missing)
- Too many variables → burnout and unusable output

If you are the doer, bring a ghost chart to your manager and ask: "Is this the win?"

## Syndication with Stakeholders

Convert issue tree + workplan into a 1–2 page summary. Align early on:
- What will be analyzed
- What will be cut (deliberate shortcuts and why)
- Budget/time tradeoffs

Use syndication to secure:
- Calendar commitments for key decision points
- Cooperation and data access
- Early risk mitigation (anticipated obstacles)

Have hard scope/budget conversations early — not after the work is done.

---

## Client Signal Reading

Don't listen only to words — interpret **tone + body language + context**.

When the room is overly optimistic, inject: **"What could make this fail?"**

Use the discomfort to surface hidden operational risks early, then convert them into mitigation actions. A single contrarian question can unlock the team's risk intelligence.
