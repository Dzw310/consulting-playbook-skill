# B2 Module A: De-Anchoring and Problem Definition

## 3-Level Move: Agree → Reframe → Expand

Use this exact sequence when the client is anchored on one lever:

1. **Agree** on the higher-level objective: "Yes, the core issue is profitability."
2. **Reframe** with a clean equation: "Profit = Revenue – Cost." Break revenue into major streams.
3. **Expand** with targeted questions that force scope clarity:
   - "What share of revenue is each stream?"
   - "Are there hard constraints on cost actions?"
4. **Propose a diagnostic** that protects the client's timeline: "3–5 days to scan all levers, then commit."

**Why it works:** Clients cannot "disagree" with a complete logical structure. Ask for *shares (mix)* before debating which levers matter.

## Influence Toolkit (Least → Most Confrontational)

Deploy in order:

1. **Lay down a framework** — objective decomposition ("Profit = Revenue – Cost")
2. **Back-of-the-envelope math** — order-of-magnitude impact (back-of-envelope is a weapon when data is missing)
3. **Storytelling** — peer analogy ("We saw this at another client...")
4. **End-game visioning** — "What if we're wrong? What happens in 12 months?"
5. **Diagnostic proposal** — low-investment broad scan to reduce perceived risk of exploring alternatives

## Problem Statement SOP

Write the problem as a **question**, not a statement.

- **Too generic:** "Should we improve margins?" → trivial yes
- **Too specific:** "Should we raise digital pricing by 15%?" → bakes in the answer
- **Right level:** "What opportunities exist to improve margins via new products, pricing, and distribution channels?"

The problem statement is an **alignment device**: share with team/client, debate scope, revise until aligned. Different problem statements lead to different workplans.

## Deliverable Clarity Checklist

Before scoping begins, clarify:

1. **Definition of success** — what does "done" look like, and who must sign off?
2. **Constraints** — markets in/out, M&A allowed or not, timing requirements
3. **Precision required** — rough estimate vs decimal-level model
4. **Client's existing hypotheses** — surface them early to shortcut where valid, anticipate bias where wrong
5. **Proactive deliverable shaping** — clients often can't specify well; propose what "good" looks like

A "PowerPoint deck" is not a deliverable. Specify: keep/kill list + rationale, financial impact (ongoing + one-time), stakeholder narrative, transition plan, org change implications.

## Key Traps to Avoid

| Trap | Correct Move |
|------|-------------|
| Accepting client's solution as the problem | Treat it as a hypothesis; expand search space to 2–3 alternative drivers |
| "Either integrity OR relationship" false choice | Use structure + low-risk next steps (diagnostic phase) to hold independent view and keep chemistry |
| Jumping from "pain" → "single solution" | Ask "what else could plausibly drive this outcome?" before committing |
| Skipping precision on client hypotheses | Ask early; prevents surprise pushback late in the project |
