# B3 Module A: Managing Strategy Projects

## 4-Phase Spine

**Plan → Launch → Manage → Close**

Each phase is a distinct risk-control system:
- **Plan:** reduce unknowns
- **Launch:** align people
- **Manage:** keep execution on track
- **Close:** lock learning + cement relationships

---

## Sub-Module 1: Prioritize by Lead Time + Dependency Risk (Not Just Due Dates)

Run a **3-metric prioritization** for every task:

1. **Due-date proximity** (deadline pressure)
2. **Lead time** (how long it takes end-to-end, including waiting on others)
3. **Controllability / dependency risk** (how much depends on third parties or unclear process)

Prioritize tasks that are **long-lead and low-control first**, even if their deadlines are later.

**Principle:** Deadline-only prioritization is a fragile plan. It ignores lead time and dependency risk. Locking exec calendars and initiating IT data conversations on Day 1 is non-negotiable — these are black boxes and third-party dependent.

---

## Sub-Module 2: De-Black-Box Monolithic Tasks

If a task label is vague ("do survey," "get IT data"), assume it hides a chain. Force an 8-step drill-down:

1. Clarify objective
2. Design instrument (survey / data spec)
3. Define sampling / access path
4. Recruit respondents / secure data owners
5. Execute (fieldwork / extraction)
6. Clean + validate
7. Analyze + synthesize
8. Deliverable packaging

Then ask: which sub-step is the bottleneck and who owns it? You cannot know if you are "on track" until you decompose and talk to owners.

---

## Sub-Module 3: IT/Data Requests — Two Failure Modes + One Mandatory Hedge

Two risks for every IT/data dependency:
- **Latency risk:** "We can give you sample data in 2 months"
- **Translation/quality risk:** You get data fast, but it's wrong/incomplete because the request was misunderstood

**Mandatory hedge:** Request a **sample dataset early** to inspect fields + quality and confirm mutual understanding. A sample pull is the cheapest form of risk reduction in data-dependent work.

---

## Sub-Module 4: Workplan vs Activity Plan (Use Both)

| Tool | Purpose | Answers |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Workplan** | Coverage — every leaf has analysis + deliverable + owner + timing | "Have we missed anything?" |
| **Activity Plan** | Control — day-to-day visibility, critical path, milestones | "Can we deliver on time?" |

Use workplan to be complete; use activity plan to be executable.

---

## Sub-Module 5: Build the Activity Plan (1-Page Gantt)

1. Bucket activities by **data source + analysis type** (customer / competitor / cost)
2. Lay out start/end dates visually (Gantt-style)
3. Mark critical milestones/meetings
4. Assign owners
5. Identify dependencies + critical path

If it isn't skimmable in 30 seconds, it won't manage the project.

---

## Sub-Module 6: Pressure-Test the Activity Plan (Robustness Checklist)

Question cluster to force-check:

1. **Granularity** — are any activities too coarse and hiding work?
2. **Duration sanity** — do time estimates match reality/experience?
3. **Critical path** — which tasks must not slip?
4. **Resource allocation** — are the strongest people staffed on critical path work?
5. **Skill-task fit** — do owners have the right capability mix?
6. **Meetings are real** — have key stakeholders locked the milestone meetings? (Written ≠ confirmed)
7. **What's at risk** — where do third parties control success? What de-risk action exists?

---

## Sub-Module 7: Communication Plan (Buy-In as a Managed Workstream)

Create a communication plan during planning/launch:

1. Map stakeholders: **decision makers, budget holders, implementers, gatekeepers**
2. Anticipate reactions to likely recommendation paths (scenario thinking)
3. Seed alignment activities early so the final meeting is not the first conflict

"Getting to the answer" is different from "getting it accepted." Buy-in is a workstream, not a finale.

---

## Sub-Module 8: Three Buy-In Tactics

| Tactic | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **1:1 alignment meetings** | Understand concerns, co-design win-win outcomes |
| **Decision workshops** | Force a go/no-go commitment by a specific date |
| **Field trips** | Expose execs directly to market reality (retail walk, focus group behind one-way mirror) |

Direct customer exposure often beats any slide-based persuasion.

---

## Sub-Module 9: Team Charter (Skip Storming, Reach Performing Faster)

Run a team charter early using **Forming → Storming → Norming → Performing** lens:

1. Work objectives + approach
2. Roles + responsibilities
3. Individual goals (development aspirations)
4. Operating cadence (meetings, updates, feedback loops)
5. Lifestyle/workstyle constraints (weekends, quiet time, time blocks)

Most team dysfunction comes from unspoken norms, not bad intent. The charter makes defaults explicit.

---

## Sub-Module 10: Client Launch — First Impressions and "We" Language

1. Co-craft sponsor message introducing who you are + why you matter
2. Anticipate skepticism: "Why consultants?" Prepare a crisp value proposition
3. Avoid "us vs them" signals: dress, seating, language
4. Adopt client vocabulary; avoid forcing your jargon
5. Transition from "you" to "we" thoughtfully — not prematurely

---

## Sub-Module 11: Skill–Will Matrix for Underperformance

Diagnose before acting:

| | **High Will** | **Low Will** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Skill** | Delegate (align outcomes, then empower) | Motivate (unlock incentives, purpose, fit) |
| **Low Skill** | Coach/Mentor (build capability, structured path) | High-touch intervention (tight control; may require staffing change) |

Start with: "I'm trying to understand what's driving this" — not blame.

---

## Sub-Module 12: De-Risk Delegation (5 Steps)

When performance is uncertain, don't place a big bet:

1. Set **advanced deadlines** (buffer before integration)
2. Define **interim deliverables** every 2–3 days
3. Use **small pilot tasks** to test capability quickly
4. Provide **coaching** where skill gaps exist
5. Use **Ghost Charting** to ensure aligned outputs before execution

Buffer + checkpoints convert uncertainty into manageable risk.

---

## Sub-Module 13: Self-Management — Own the Structure

When your manager doesn't provide structure, proactively:

1. Draft the problem statement and confirm it
2. Outline the issue tree / workplan logic
3. Clarify your deliverables and timing
4. Identify key stakeholders
5. Bring ghost charts to align before investing effort

"Let me confirm my understanding" is a power move, not insecurity.

---

## Sub-Module 14: Escalate Right — Bring Solutions, Not Problems

When escalating:
- What you tried
- Why it failed
- 2–3 solution paths with trade-offs

Ask for guidance on which path to pursue. Managers remember the person who brings options, not the person who brings panic.

---

## Sub-Module 15: End-Product Orientation (Daily Storyline Discipline)

Every day, reserve 20–30 minutes to answer:
1. What did we learn today?
2. How does it change the storyline?
3. What are the implications for the client?

**Deliverable standard:** ~20 pages supporting analysis + ~3 pages key takeaways + 1-page executive summary (conclusions + implications). Not 100 pages of analysis.

Early synthesis trains consulting judgment; waiting trains passivity.

---

## Sub-Module 16: Tornado Moments — 3-Legged Stool

When the project suddenly destabilizes (scope creep, time compression, resource loss):

- If **time is fixed** → adjust scope or add resources
- If **resources drop** → reduce scope or extend time
- If **scope increases** → add time or add resources

Communicate via options: "Yes, and here are the implications." Option framing preserves trust while enforcing constraints.

---

## Sub-Module 17: Closeout

More than the final deck:

1. **Team postmortem:** what worked, hurdles, replicable lessons, what to do differently
2. **Close loose ends:** side insights, additional commitments
3. **Client wrap:** gratitude, handoff, stay-in-touch plan, follow-up later to learn implementation outcomes

The last impression often determines repeat work and long-term trust.

## Easy-to-Miss Checklist (Pre-Delivery)

- [ ] Did you lock exec calendars early for scarce stakeholders?
- [ ] Did you request a data sample early to validate fields/quality?
- [ ] Did you identify critical path and staff strongest capacity onto it?
- [ ] Are milestone meetings confirmed (not just written)?
- [ ] Are you managing buy-in as a workstream, not a finale?

A robust plan makes risks surface in week 1, not week 8.
